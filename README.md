# Zayada

Zayada is an Arabic version of makemore, which I have coded by following along Andrei Karpathy's Neural Networks: Zero to Hero playlist. The goal is to create a neural network that generates new names after learning from a dataset of common names. Each video increases the complexity of the network and thus their performance.

Neural networks implemented:
- Bigram model
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
