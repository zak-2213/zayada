# Zayada

Zayada is an Arabic version of makemore, which I have coded by following along Andrei Karpathy's Neural Networks: Zero to Hero playlist. The goal is to create a neural network that generates new names after learning from a dataset of common names. Each video increases the complexity of the network and thus their performance.

Neural networks implemented:
- Bigram model: loss = 2.71
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): loss = 2.44
- WaveNet: loss = 2.42
